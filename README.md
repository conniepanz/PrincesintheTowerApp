### The Princes in The Tower: Who Did It?
In 1485, two young Princes disappeared from the Tower of London. To this day, no one can say for sure what happened to them. Was it their uncle, King Richard III, who killed them to take the crown? Was it their cousin the Duke of Buckingham to clear his path to the throne? Was it rival claimant and future King Henry Tudor, who viewed them as a threat? No one can say for sure. But here is a forum for you to post your theory as to why they are gone.

This is my second project at General Assembly and my goal was to create a full stack web application hosted on Github pages with an API hosted on Heroku. The goals were to:

* Build a single-page application (SPA) with basic user authentication (sign up, sign in, sign out, change password) that interacts with a custom API that you build

* Build an app that can create, read, update, and delete data in a database

* Learn to create user stories and wireframes (before writing code) as part of planning out your app.

* Learn to confidently present your work to a technical audience (5-10 minute presentation)


* Links

* Front End Repo (https://princesinthetower.herokuapp.com)

* Back End Repo (https://github.com/conniepanz/PrincesintheTowerApp)

* Deployed Client ( https://conniepanz.github.io/PrincesintheTower-client/)

* Deployed API (https://princesinthetower.herokuapp.com)

Planning: In order to plan, I designed wireframes of what I wanted to include in the project. I drew an ERD and wrote out user stories. I followed the schedule that GA set out for me.

Challenges: I had many challenges on this project and I had to scale back my ambitions to make it work.

 ### User Stories

 As a user, I want to be able to sign up and have my information stored.

 As a user, I want to be able to sign in and have my information stored.

 As a user, if I forget or misplace my password, I want to be able to change passwords.

 As a user, I want to log out.

 As a user, I want to read about the Princes in the Tower.

 As a user, I want enter a suspect and the reason why I suspect them.

 As a user, I want to update the suspect form.

 As a user, I want to view all of the suspects I entered.

 ### Technologies Used

 * html
 * css
 * Boostrap
 * Node.js
 * Express
 * Mongo DB
 * Mongoose
 * Herokou
 * JQuery
 * Ajax

 ### Unsolved Problems

 * The layout is clunky. I want to be able to dynamically delete and update.
 * My probability feature only works part of the time.
 * The style is not completed.

 ### Plan for the Future
 * Improve the styling
 * Dynamically update and delete
 * Add suspect slideshow with info on each suspect
 * Create a message board so people can respond with comments

 ### ERD
